# Prismata AI Engine
This repository contains the C++ AI Engine for [Prismata](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490220/Prismata/) (by [Lunarch Studios](http://lunarchstudios.com/)). The Prismata AI is a completely standalone project from the retail game client, and comes with an offline GUI writtten in C++/SFML that you can use to implement your own Prismata AI, or modify / play against the existing AI.

* **Prismata_GUI**: A fully functional SFML GUI for playing offline Prismata games vs. the AI
* **Prismata_Standalone**: Used to create a standalone executable to replace the actual Prismata client AI executable so you can play against the AI you create in the real game client
* **Prismata_Testing**: Used to benchmark, test, and run tournaments between AI agents
